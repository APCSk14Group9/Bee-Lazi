We have the suggestion for film and food.

For instance, in the film:
	- add_class_to_film_data.py is the file that generates randoms class for each data point, it will range from 1 through 8
	- training.py is the file that learning the data using Adaboost, 
		then it turns around predicting on that data and get the predicted classes. 
		Sort the predicted class decreasing to get the rank_list	
	- feedback.py, the input is rank_list, now user need to specify which option to be selected to update the original classes.

How to run:
add_class_to_film_data is run only once at the beginning.
then, run training and feedback repeatedly.
